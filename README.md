# pythonvchange

A basic bash script that I can change the softlinked version of python with on my ubuntu desktop machine. A lot of apps I have installed use 2.7 and break when I change the softlink so I wanted to make something I could change it with quickly.

I might add to it a bit later if it breaks on other distro's.
