# pythonvchange

A basic bash script that I can change the softlinked version of python with on my ubuntu desktop machine. A lot of apps I have installed use 2.7 and break when I change the softlink so I wanted to make something I could change it with quickly.

I might add to it a bit later if it breaks on other distro's.

* Since updateing this I have discovered update-alternatives and vevnv, so I dont really use it anymore. It *is* nice to have something that will run as a user though (even if I have to add the relevant commands to sudoers.d)
